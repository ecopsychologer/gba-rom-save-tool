A tool to transfer, convert, and sync srm/sav files between a local and external source for example between a handheld gaming device with an sd card for games/storage and a steam deck. This tool aims to bring some level of "easy" syncing to allow one to quickly switch between devices more quickly.

Please clone [srm-to-sav](https://github.com/c99koder/srm-to-sav) and put it in this repository's folder.
